What is Crimer
--------------
Crimer is an interface that, when provided a city name by user input, will parse through NewsAPI for headlines
relating to crime within the specified geographic region. These headlines are passed to both our probabilistic
machine learning algorithm and our neural network machine learning algorithm, which then act to classify the 
headlines based on the type of crime and identify the location in which the incident occurred. These classified headlines, along with the locations, are then displayed in the form of a color-coded heatmap in an interface for the user.
